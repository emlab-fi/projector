 Simple monte carlo based high energy ($>$1 k\+Ev) photon transport simulator. Developed as by Oldřich Pecák in Em\+Lab during his PhD. Aim of the simulator is to be a simplified simulator which can be used as a performance proxy application.

Algorithmically similar to common standard simulators (MCNP, Open\+MC, PENELOPE, Serpent).

Currently uses \href{https://nucleardata.lanl.gov/ace/eprdata14/}{\texttt{ eprdata14}} ACE as cross section source.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Structure}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
