# Planned features

- purely photon transport simulator (does not calculate secondary photons for now)
- geometry based on computational solid geometry and boundary representation

- input data defined in JSON
- tooling for visualization of input geometry

- calculates all the rays first, then tallies

- latter add support for latices (instances)
- later add support for volume calculation?
- latter add support for normal meshes (STL?)


# Cross section and form factor data
- uses standard ACE as input
- more specifically, the eprdata14 - https://nucleardata.lanl.gov/ace/eprdata14/
- used data:
    - coherent, incoherent, photoelectric absorption and pair production cross sections
    - coherent and incoherent form factors/functions
