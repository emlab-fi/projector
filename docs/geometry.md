# Geometry

- uses combination of computational solid geometry and bounday representation
- why boundary: easy to calculate distances and projects
- why csg: easy to combine surface to form volumes
- "helper" objects: box, capped cylinder
- other surface: generic plane, ellipsoid, elliptic paraboloid, elliptic cone, elliptic cone, general quadric

- surfaces form trees to define a volume, basic operations: intersect, join, substract (, inverse)

- top level object (universe/environment) is a bounding box

- sampling random points:
    - hmm, idk?

- latter add support for normal meshes (STL?)
