# Projector computation principle

## Sample the volume to create particle origin
- sample PRNG for position and energy distribution
- only done once for each particle

## Calculate distance to next collision
- exponentional function
- check if we crossed surface boundary and possibly reflect back
- determine cell(volume), get crosssections and and calculate interaction


# Interactions calculation

## Photoeletric Absorption
- as we do not care about resulting particles, the photon just gets stopped

## Coherent Scattering (Rayleigh)
-

## Incoherent Scattering (Compton)
-

## Pair Production
- as we do not care about resulting particles, the photon just gets stopped
